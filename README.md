This is a Firefox extension which provides a small toolbar to navigate throught
a website, on websites that provide the right "link types", as described in the
[link types section](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/types.html#type-links
HTML Link types) of the HTML 4 specifications.

This is useful if you are browsing documentation, such as those produced by the
[Sphinx documentation project](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ Sphinx website).

This extension currently only works with Firefox 4.0b or greater.

You can download the releases [on the project website](http://multani.info/projects/jetpack-html-navigation/releases).
